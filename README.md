# Automated front-end testing with React Testing Library

## About the repository
This repository aims to demonstrate how React Testing Library can be used to automate testing in a frontend
application built using React. As a part of a DevOps course [DD2482 Automated Software Testing and DevOps](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2482?l=en), this was
developed in collaboration with Julian Nalenz (bonnici@kth.se, [@nalenz](https://github.com/nalenz)).

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. Clone this repository ``git clone https://github.com/elibon99/react-testing-library-demo.git``
2. ``cd`` into the repository and run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies.


### Run the application
To run the actual application, execute the following command.
```
npm start
```
This will start the web application on your local machine and open up the application in your default web-browser. 


### Run the tests
To run the tests, execute the following command:
```
npm test
```
After running the above command, a menu in the terminal will be displayed in which you can decide to run all the tests. Enter ``a`` 
to run all tests. This will run all test suites defined in the project (3 in total), and their corresponding test cases (8 in total).
